### New RN

I'm returning to this project with a bit of time; have been busy with interviews and exercises.
Since RN has breaking changes so fast, and is evolving so fast, plus I wanted to do this anyway:  Go back to the start, set up some apps with Expo and/or `create-react-native-app`, since it's likely they'll be keeping the breaks out of this system... Then try to port our pattern basic structure into this.  This can become the new RN seed app; initially will be using it for the BrujoTerm for developer interface on the progression of the backend development with the new dev-ops tooling -- the bot-net basically.
